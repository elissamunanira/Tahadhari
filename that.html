Many people meet with this issues, where their partners have been start to use the home properties for non profitable activities to the family and decides to claim getting their own in order to manage them as well as the want.
In order to solve that kind of the problem on my point of view, the partners before going to make the agreement to share everything, they have to think twice and then make a good agreement like sharing what have gained when they are together while those one each have find on their way before having married stay to each one on their side. Thank you.
